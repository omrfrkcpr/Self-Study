//! Write a JavaScript program that computes and prints the first n Fibonacci numbers without using any built-in functions (like Math.pow, Math.sqrt, Array methods, etc.) or arrays.

//! - You must not use any built-in JavaScript functions related to Fibonacci sequences or arrays.
//! - The program should prompt the user for the value of n.
//! - Display the first n Fibonacci numbers.
//! Example: For n = 7, the Fibonacci sequence would be: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
