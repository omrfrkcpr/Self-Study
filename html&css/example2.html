    <h3>What is JavaScript and why it is used?</h3>

    <p style="border: 2px solid red">
      JavaScript os a scripting or programming language that allows you to
      implement complex features on web pages <br />
      every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
      information for you to look at <br />
      displayin timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/#d
      graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. <br />
      you can bet that JavaScript is probably inveolved. It is the third layer
      of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and
      CSS) weh have covered in much detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

        HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to
        our web content, for example defining paragraphs, heading, and data
        tables, or embedding images and videos in the page
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our
        HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and
        laying out our content in multiple columns.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you tu create
        dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images and
        pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing
        what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of
      the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming
      Interface (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your
      JavaScript code.
